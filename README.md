# FridgeMate
This project was done for a hackathon with a small group of 2 partners and was my first serious attempt at creating a project. 
FridgeMate is designed to be a simple website that allows users to put in ingredients they have in their fridge and the website will return a list of recipes that can be created.
It uses a local JSON server currently but we're trying it to use an online and more extensive database of ingredients and recipes.
